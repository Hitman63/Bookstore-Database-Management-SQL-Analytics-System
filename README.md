**Bookstore Database Management & SQL Analytics System**

This project focuses on the design, implementation, and analysis of a bookstore database using MySQL Workbench, aimed at managing and extracting insights from structured retail data. The database is organized into three core entities: Books (catalog, pricing, and inventory details), Customers (profiles and purchase behavior), and Orders (sales and transaction records). The project involves writing both basic and advanced SQL queries, including filtering, aggregations, joins, subqueries, and nested conditions, to analyze sales performance, identify high-value customers, monitor inventory levels, and support business reporting. Overall, this project demonstrates practical database design, data management, and SQL analytics skills applicable to real-world data analysis and business intelligence scenarios.
